algotest
========

The goal of this repository is to create a comprehensive testsuite for algorithms.
Although the testsuite is intended to be language neutral, the initial target is
to cover all algorithms specified by the C++ standard library. Where applicable,
the algorithm names and the specification from the C++ standard is used.
